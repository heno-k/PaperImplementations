# PaperImplementations
This project is a portfolio of Machine Learning research papers that I will implement in the future. In the meantime, I am building up my fundamentals
by understanding popular architectures used in Machine Learning. I have already gone in depth on Convolutional Neural Networks and recently scratched the
surface of Transformers.
